# LLM-Utility-Cookbook

Hello, future LLM enthusiasts! Welcome to the LLM-Utility-Cookbook, a place where we'll explore, understand, and play with a myriad of tools and techniques related to Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository serves as an extension of our lectures, bridging theory and practice in the most interactive way possible.

## Our Learning Menu 📜

Here's what we'll be exploring together:

1. **Voice to Text**: We'll unravel the magic behind turning spoken words into written text.
2. **Text to Voice**: A dive into how we can transform static text into expressive audible speech.
3. **[Document Scan to Text](https://github.com/Fuenfgeld/LLM-Utility-Cookbook/blob/bada77091ff6eab6dd3647ef1d1ef8005c6801e2/ScanToText.ipynb)**: Learn how to breathe digital life into your physical documents.
4. **Prompts**: Together, we'll optimize and manage prompts to extract the most from our LLMs.
5. **Memory**: Get hands-on with persisting states between calls in a chain or agent.
6. **Indexes**: We'll tinker with loading, querying, and updating external data.
7. **Chains**: Discover the art of crafting structured sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities.
8. **Agents**: Learn to create agents that decide, act, and learn until a task is complete.
9. **Callbacks**: Dive into the world of debugging and introspection with callbacks.
